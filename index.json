[{"categories":["Supply Chain"],"contents":"Question1 The file 10node.xlsx contains data for a 10- node instance of the UFLP, with nodes located on the unit square and I = J, pictured in Figure 8.22. The file lists the x- and y-coordinates, demands hi, and fixed costs fj for each node, as well as the transportation cost cij between each pair of nodes i and j. Transportation costs equal 10 times the Euclidean distance between the nodes. All fixed costs equal 200. Solve this instance of the UFLP exactly by implementing the UFLP in the modeling language of your choice and solving it with a MIP solver. Report the optimal locations, optimal assignments, and optimal cost.\nLanguage/ Tool/ Package Python  gurobipy: The Gurobi Optimizer is a mathematical optimization software library for solving mixed-integer linear and quadratic optimization problems. pandas: open source data analysis and manipulation tool itertools: this module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML.
