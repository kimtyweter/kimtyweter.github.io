It can be used to record life, and at the same time, you can receive updates from friends through Instagram. But sometimes I often find that my number of followers are decreasing, or sometimes, one or two fans are inexplicably lost.\nTask I designed a tracker for unfollowers. I hope I can use programming language to find out who unfollowed my Instagram. Therefore, let\u0026rsquo;s review whether there are some changes in the relationship between yourself and Unfollowers or something to be vigilant about.\nAction The framework is listed below: Result  Demo Code  ","permalink":"https://kimtyweter.github.io/blog/instagram-unfollwers/","tags":["Python","C++","Scheduling"],"title":"Who Unfollow My Instagram?

The results of the study found that low-income groups are more likely to be exposed to PM2.5 harmful substances. Detailed research report can refer to the link. This article is dedicated to presenting the advanced drawing methods and drawing results used in the research.\nLanguage SQL: Querying data from the database Python: Data processing and Data visualization  Matplotlib Seaborn Geopandas  Data Visualization 1. Map and Scatter plot with density This graph presents a density map of PM2.5 emissions in Harris County, Texas. If the amount of discharge is larger, it is represented by a larger circle; if the amount of discharge is small, it is represented by a small blue circle. Both the shade of color and the size of the circle are related to emissions. Code\n2. Handmade grid map with density This picture uses the latitude and longitude cutting method to cut the longitude and latitude of Harris County. And calculate the household Income of the square for Segregation transformation, and visualize it as shown above. Code\n3. CBGs based map with density This graph uses CBGs (Census Block Group) as a unit to show the differences of Income in various regions. Code\n4. Professional expression of line-bar, scatterplot, and histogram The following four images show the line-bar, scatterplot, and histogram used in professional journals, respectively.\nLine bar This figure shows the income presentation of the four income groups, and adds the error barss to indicate the 95% confidence interval in the gap between groups. If the error bar overlaps between the two groups, it means that the difference between the two groups is not significant. Code\nScatterplot Scatter plots can be used to show the relationship between probability densities and variable series. At the same time, this figure also compares the probability density of two different variables. Code\nHistogram This figure demonstrates the flexibility to control the difference between bin and n. In addition, the visibility of the data can be better reflected through the transformation of color. Code\n5. Advanced Line bar chart This graph shows the relationship between different emitting industries and human activities. Through advanced drawing techniques, we distinguish the positive and negative values ​​of the data with different colors, and also classify the total emissions of various industries with colors.

Manpower shortage and manpower surplus are both key factors that affect the operation of the company, because the shortage of manpower will make the service level of the company decline, and affect the reputation of the company or the perception of the company. If there is excess manpower, it is a waste of the company\u0026rsquo;s labor costs.\nTask I try to combine the three methods of data science, programming, and optimization methods into one, and integrate these three methods into a system to help companies achieve the purpose of human resource optimization.\nAction First, I predict the incoming telephone line volume of the next month, and convert the predicted results into the required manpower through systematic simulation. Finally, we will apply the mathematical model of linear programming to convert the manpower constraints and company policies into several mathematically expressed sets of decision variables, an objective function, and a set of constraints. Lastly, I apply them to the genetic algorithm developed in C++ to allocate human resources. The end result is the shift schedule that each customer service employee receives.\nResult  Scheduling work efficiency: one day becomes half an hour Early warning effect: the rate of absenteeism can be calculated, so that the call center can be prepared Manpower utilization: 82% to 89%  ","permalink":"https://kimtyweter.github.io/blog/scheduling/","tags":["Python","C++","Scheduling"],"title":"Scheduling with Genertic Algorithm"},{"categories":["Supply Chain"],"contents":"Question1 The file 10node.xlsx contains data for a 10- node instance of the UFLP, with nodes located on the unit square and I = J, pictured in Figure 8.22.
